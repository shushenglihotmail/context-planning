# Changelog

All notable changes to **context-planning (`cp`)** are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet — open an issue if you want something prioritised.

## v0.6.0 — Quality Wave (CI, dual-binary, command decomposition, coverage)

**Milestone goal:** Production-hardening pass — break up the
monolithic `bin/cp.js`, expose a `cplan` alias to dodge PowerShell's
built-in `cp`, ship multi-OS CI, and gate on coverage.

### Added

- **`cplan` binary alias.** `npm install -g context-planning` now creates
  both `cp` and `cplan` shims. PowerShell users hit by the built-in `cp →
  Copy-Item` alias should invoke `cplan` instead. Documented in README
  with a callout. Help text, `cp doctor` banner, and CLI usage all note
  the dual name.

- **`bin/commands/<name>.js` module layout.** Every command is now a
  standalone module exporting `{ name, run(args) }`. New registry
  (`bin/commands/index.js`) is the single source of truth for command
  lookup — 18 entries. `bin/cp.js` is now a 47-LOC thin dispatcher
  (down from 1218 LOC). Shared helpers extracted to
  `bin/commands/_helpers.js`. Test back-compat preserved
  (`module.exports = { normalizeArgv, main, registry }`).

- **GitHub Actions CI.** Matrix `{ ubuntu-latest, windows-latest } ×
  { node 20, node 22 }`. README gets a ci badge. `.github/skills/`,
  `.github/agents/`, and `.github/context-planning.md` gitignored
  (self-install dogfood artifacts) while `.github/workflows/` is
  committed.

- **`c8` coverage with threshold gate.** New `npm run coverage`
  (HTML+text, local) and `npm run coverage:ci` (lcov + json-summary +
  `--check-coverage --lines 85 --branches 75`). Coverage runs as a
  dedicated CI job after the matrix, uploads a `coverage-report`
  artifact (14-day retention). Current actual: 88.7% lines /
  78.2% branches. v0.7 should ratchet the gate.

### Fixed

- **Windows CI worktree-path comparison.** `cp worktree list` compared
  registry path against `git worktree list --porcelain` output via
  `path.resolve()`. Windows GitHub Actions runners expose temp paths
  via 8.3 short names (`RUNNER~1`) so the registry stored the short
  form while git returned the long form, and the lookup always missed.
  New `canonical()` wraps `fs.realpathSync.native` (which
  GetFinalPathNameByHandle-resolves on Windows) and `samePath()`
  lowercases on win32. Surfaces only on GitHub runners.

- **Cross-platform `unit-statusline.js`.** Dropped a `shell: 'cmd.exe'
  + 2>NUL` invocation that ENOENT'd on Ubuntu.

### Notes for users

- `cp install` re-runs are idempotent; if you have a globally installed
  `cp < v0.6.0`, run `npm install -g context-planning@latest` then
  `cp install copilot` (or your harness) again to get the `cplan` shim
  and updated skill stubs.
- No breaking changes; all 19 test suites (753 assertions) pass on
  Ubuntu+Windows × Node 20+22.

## v0.5.0 — Generic provider / harness detection

**Milestone goal:** Restructure provider detection from hardcoded literal
sentinel matching to a data-driven harnesses × providers cross-product, so
adding a new harness or provider is a config-only edit — no code changes.

### Added

- **Harnesses block** in `templates/config.json` — 4 harnesses (copilot,
  claude, cursor, aider) with `plugin_roots` using trailing-`*` glob specs.
  Each harness declares where its plugins live on disk.

- **`plugin_shape`** on each provider — `dir_name` + `required_subdirs`.
  Detection scans every harness's expanded plugin roots for a child dir
  matching the shape, verifying required subdirs exist.

- **`lib/detect.js`** (~250 LOC) — new detection engine:
  - `expandRoot()`: tilde expansion + trailing-`*` segment glob via
    `fs.readdirSync` (zero external deps).
  - `detectProviderAtAnyHarness()`: harnesses × plugin_shape cross-product
    with fallback to legacy `detect.any_of` literal sentinels.
  - `detectAllInstalled()`: full scan returning harness + provider reports.

- **`lib/merge.js`** (~150 LOC) — additive config merge engine:
  - `mergeCpDefaults()`: unions arrays (detect.any_of, plugin_roots),
    deep-merges objects with user-wins precedence, bumps schema version.
  - Never deletes user data.

- **Auto-heal merge** in `loadConfig()`: first v0.5 invocation in a
  brownfield project silently merges new upstream defaults (sentinels,
  harnesses, providers, schema bump) and writes back, with a stderr notice.

- **`cp config refresh [--dry-run]`** command: explicit re-sync of local
  config with upstream defaults. `--dry-run` reports planned changes
  without writing.

- **`cp doctor` rewrite**: sectioned output showing harnesses → providers →
  configured → roles → GSD compat. New flags: `--json` (machine-parsable),
  `--quiet` (minimal).

- **`echo-provider`** schema-test stub: proves the detection schema works
  with more than Superpowers. Install with `cp install echo-provider`,
  switch with `cp config set workflow_provider echo-provider`.

- **Schema version 2**: `cp.version` bumped from 1 to 2. Informational
  marker for future migrations.

### Changed

- `lib/provider.js` slimmed — detection logic moved to `lib/detect.js`.
  Back-compat exports (`detectProvider`, `existsAnywhere`) preserved as
  wrappers.

- `templates/config.json` Claude Code harness `plugin_roots` fixed: was
  `~/.claude/plugins/*/` (wrong — no marketplace wrapper); now
  `~/.claude/plugins/` (flat plugin dir).

### Fixed

- Brownfield projects init'd against v0.4.x no longer silently miss new
  upstream sentinels. The auto-heal merge adds them on first load.

### Tests

- 4 new test files: `unit-detect.js` (47), `unit-merge.js` (42),
  `dryrun-doctor.js` (29), `dryrun-config-refresh.js` (16).
- Total: **~760 assertions** across 19 test files (up from 592 in v0.4.5).
- All tests use `os.homedir()` monkey-patching for host isolation.

## v0.4.5 — Copilot CLI marketplace Superpowers detection

**Fix:** `cp doctor` now correctly detects Superpowers installed via the
Copilot CLI marketplace (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/superpowers-marketplace/`).
Previously the default sentinel list only matched Claude Code install
layouts (`.claude/plugins/...` and `.github/skills/...`), so Copilot CLI
users silently fell through to the manual provider for every workflow
role.

The fix is purely additive — three new sentinels in
`templates/config.json` `cp.providers.superpowers.detect.any_of` cover
the upstream marketplace install path with broad-then-specific
granularity matching the existing Claude detection pattern. No changes
to detection logic in `lib/provider.js`; `existsAnywhere()` already
searched under `~/.copilot/`.

Users with existing `.planning/config.json` files retain their values
(the cp-block-merge in `loadConfig` is non-destructive); they should
remove any local `installed-plugins/...` sentinel override they added
manually to keep the config aligned with upstream defaults.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-05-20

Hotfix wave surfaced by the `/cp-map-codebase --force` dogfood against
v0.4.3. Closes two HIGH concerns recorded in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`.

### Fixed — `install/aider.js` no longer clobbers user `read:` entries

- **Bug**: v0.4.2 / v0.4.3 edited `.aider.conf.yml` with a regex-fenced
  block (`# >>> context-planning (cp) ...`). If the user already had a
  top-level `read:` list **outside** the fence, both lists survived and
  Aider's YAML parse used the later one — cp's block silently overrode the
  user's other `read:` entries.
- **Fix**: `patchAiderConfig` now parses `.aider.conf.yml` with the `yaml`
  module (already a direct dependency), appends `.aider/CP-CONTEXT.md` to
  the existing `read:` list (deduped), and re-emits valid YAML. User keys
  and `read:` entries are preserved.
- **Migration**: a legacy fenced block from v0.4.2 / v0.4.3 is auto-stripped
  on first run after upgrade; the entry is re-added to the proper `read:`
  list. Status returned is `migrated`.
- **Known limitation**: comments inside `.aider.conf.yml` are not preserved
  through `YAML.parse` → `YAML.stringify`. Keys and values survive; inline
  comments do not.

### Fixed — `lib/worktree.js` now owns the git shell-outs

- **Pattern violation**: in v0.4.3, `bin/cp.js cmdWorktreeCreate`,
  `cmdWorktreeList`, and `cmdWorktreeRemove` shelled out to `git worktree`
  directly with `spawnSync`/`execSync`. Every other shell-out in cp lives
  in a `lib/*` module so the CLI handler stays a thin dispatcher.
- **Fix**: extracted `runGitWorktreeAdd`, `runGitWorktreeRemove`, and
  `listGitWorktrees` into `lib/worktree.js`. The CLI handlers now call
  through the lib and keep responsibility only for printing and exit codes.

### Added — coverage

- `test/unit-installers.js` — +8 assertions across two new sections:
  user `read:` preservation (proves the v0.4.4 fix) and legacy fenced
  block migration (proves backward compatibility).
- `test/unit-worktree.js` — +6 assertions for the new shell-out helpers
  including `listGitWorktrees` against a real `git init`'d repo.

### Tests

- 751 assertions across 14 suites — `npm test` (was 737).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-05-20

Adds **`cp worktree {create,list,remove}`** — git-worktree management with
optional Superpowers provider hand-off. Closes the v0.4 roadmap item
"optional Superpowers worktree integration".

### Added — `cp worktree`

- **`cp worktree create <name> [--branch <b>] [--from <base>] [--path <dir>] [--phase <N>] [--no-create] [--use-provider]`** —
  runs `git worktree add <path> -b cp/<slug>` with sensible defaults (sibling
  directory `<repo>-<slug>`, branch `cp/<slug>`) and records the entry in
  `.planning/WORKTREES.md`. Auto-commits scoped to `WORKTREES.md` only (v0.3.3
  invariant preserved).
- **`cp worktree list [--json]`** — shows registered worktrees,
  cross-referenced against `git worktree list --porcelain` so you can see at
  a glance which entries still have their directory on disk.
- **`cp worktree remove <slug> [--force] [--no-commit]`** — runs
  `git worktree remove <path>` and drops the registry entry. Refuses (exit 1)
  if git refuses (e.g. dirty worktree) unless `--force` is passed.
- **`--use-provider` opt-in delegation.** When set, cp resolves the
  configured workflow provider's `worktree` role (Superpowers maps it to
  `using-git-worktrees`) and emits a hand-off line instead of running git
  itself. The harness picks up the skill name and the prepared
  `git worktree add` invocation. The cp-native path remains the default —
  this is an opt-in for users who want their provider's worktree skill in
  charge.

### Added — `lib/worktree.js`

- Pure helpers: `slugify`, `defaultWorktreePath`, `defaultBranchName`,
  `parseGitWorktreeList`, `renderWorktreesDoc`, `parseWorktreesDoc`,
  `addRegistryEntry`, `removeRegistryEntry`, `listRegistry`, `isoDay`.
- Returns the same `{actions, ...}` shape as `lib/inbox.js` and the rest of
  the lifecycle ops so the CLI routes writes through `writeBatch` for free
  (atomic + transactional, per v0.3.2).

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-worktree.js`** — 56 new assertions: slugify edge cases,
  default path / branch helpers, `git worktree list --porcelain` parser
  with detached + bare entries, registry doc round-trip, parse-tolerates-noise,
  add/remove/dedupe behaviour, end-to-end CLI (`create` → `list` →
  `list --json` → `remove`), `--no-create` skip path, all usage error paths
  (no subcommand, bad subcommand, missing name/slug).
- Test totals: **737 assertions** across 14 suites, all green.

### Notes

- The cp-native path uses `git worktree add` with `-b cp/<slug>`. If your
  workflow needs a different branch convention, pass `--branch <name>`.
- `cp worktree list --json` shape: `{ registered: [...], git: [...] }` —
  `registered` is what `.planning/WORKTREES.md` knows about, `git` is what
  `git worktree list --porcelain` reports. The two should agree; when they
  drift, run `cp worktree list` to see the `on disk` / `missing` markers.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-20

Adds **`cp install cursor`** and **`cp install aider`** — two new harness
installers that bring the cp slash-command surface into Cursor IDE and
Aider, respectively. No changes to existing copilot / claude installers.

### Added — Cursor installer (`cp install cursor`)

- Installs each `commands/cp/<name>.md` as a `.cursor/rules/cp-<name>.mdc`
  rule file. Each rule has `alwaysApply: false` so it shows up in Cursor's
  rule picker / `@-attach` autocomplete without bloating every chat
  context. The source command's `description:` is hoisted into the Cursor
  frontmatter so the rule picker shows it inline.
- Installs an ambient `.cursor/rules/context-planning.mdc` (`alwaysApply:
  true`) mirroring the routing instructions we install for Copilot CLI's
  context file. This tells Cursor what cp is and how to route `/cp-*` /
  `cp-*` user invocations to the matching rule.
- Supports `CP_INSTALL_SCOPE=user` for `~/.cursor/rules/` install.
- Inherits the v0.3.4 collision protection: `--force` to clobber local
  edits, exit code 3 when local files are kept.

### Added — Aider installer (`cp install aider`)

- Aider has NO per-project slash-command or rule extension mechanism — its
  slash commands are hard-coded Python. So cp installs a read-only context
  briefing the user can pull into chat instead:
  - **`.aider/CP-CONTEXT.md`** — generated overview of the cp slash
    commands + a CLI cheat-sheet, with rules for when to invoke `cp`.
  - **`.aider/cp-commands/<name>.md`** — full per-command body, attachable
    via Aider's `/read .aider/cp-commands/<name>.md` chat command.
  - **`.aider.conf.yml`** — patched (or created) to include
    `read: - .aider/CP-CONTEXT.md` via a fenced
    `# >>> context-planning (cp)` block. Idempotent re-runs are detected.
    Hand-written keys in `.aider.conf.yml` (other YAML) are preserved.
- User asks Aider in chat (e.g. "use cp to make a new milestone called
  'foo'"); Aider sees the briefing and invokes `cp scaffold-milestone foo`
  via shell.

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-installers.js`** — 50 new assertions: `cursor.buildRule`
  frontmatter synthesis (with + without source frontmatter), e2e cursor
  install + re-run + hand-edit-refuse + `--force` clobber,
  `aider.buildContextBriefing` shape, `aider.patchAiderConfig`
  create/idempotent/preserve-user-edits, e2e aider install, `cp install
  pyramid` unknown-harness error path lists all four harnesses.
- Test totals: **681 assertions** across 13 suites, all green.

### Notes

- Both installers use the same `install/common.js writeFileSafe` helper
  shipped in v0.3.4, so they get collision protection + identical-detect
  for free.
- This closes the v0.4 README roadmap items "Cursor and Aider installers".

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-20

Adds **`cp statusline`** — a one-line prompt-friendly status indicator for
shell PS1, Starship, tmux, etc. Same-day point release on the v0.4.0
inbox-triage line; no breaking changes.

### Added — `cp statusline`

- **`cp statusline [--format <fmt>] [--json] [--no-color]`** — prints a
  compact status line resolved from `.planning/ROADMAP.md` +
  `lifecycle.statusReport`. Default output looks like
  `cp ▸ v0.5 ▸ 01-mvp 1/3 ▸ 01-02` (current milestone → active phase
  slug → done/total → next plan id). Renders ANSI colors when stdout is a
  TTY; suppresses them under `--no-color` or `NO_COLOR=1`.
- **Silent outside a cp project.** When called outside any git repo, or
  inside a git repo with no `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, statusline exits 0 with
  no output / no stderr — safe to drop into a shell prompt that runs every
  keystroke.
- **`--format <fmt>` custom template.** Tokens: `%M` (milestone), `%P`
  (phase slug, e.g. `01-mvp`), `%D` (done/total, e.g. `1/3`), `%N` (next
  plan id, e.g. `01-02`), `%B` (current git branch). Use for Starship /
  tmux / Powerline integrations.
- **`--json` for harness consumption.** Returns a stable shape with
  `milestone`, `milestoneStatus`, `phase: { num, name, label, done, total }`,
  `nextPlan: { phaseNum, phaseName, planId, desc }`, `branch`.

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-statusline.js`** — 28 new assertions: silent-outside-project
  invariants, milestone+phase rendering, `--json` shape, `--format` token
  substitution, `--no-color` ANSI suppression, `NO_COLOR` env var support,
  `%B` branch resolution, empty-milestone fallback.
- Test totals: **631 assertions** across 12 suites, all green.

### Notes

- Example PS1 integration (bash): ``PS1='$(cp statusline 2>/dev/null) \w \$ '``
- Example Starship config (`~/.config/starship.toml`):
  ```toml
  [custom.cp]
  command = "cp statusline --no-color"
  when = "test -f .planning/ROADMAP.md"
  format = "[$output]($style) "
  ```

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-20

Adds **`/cp-capture`** + the `cp capture` / `cp inbox` CLI surface — a
lightweight inbox-triage workflow for the half-formed ideas that always show
up mid-session and never make it into a phase. Pure state-layer addition;
no provider involvement required for capture/list/tick, harness-driven
routing for the triage step.

### Added — inbox capture & triage

- **`cp capture "<text>"`** — appends a free-form line to
  `.planning/INBOX.md` under the `## Open` section with an ISO-minute
  timestamp. Auto-commits unless `--no-commit`, scoped to just `INBOX.md`
  via `pathsFromActions` (won't sweep unrelated dirty files — v0.3.3
  invariant preserved).
- **`cp inbox [--json] [--all] [--tick <N> [--note <dest>]] [--no-commit]`** —
  shows the current inbox (`Open` only by default; `--all` adds `Triaged`;
  `--json` for harness consumption). `--tick <N>` moves open item N to
  Triaged with an optional `--note` destination tag (e.g. `quick:rename`,
  `phase:02-mvp`, `seed:routing-redesign`, `discard`). cp does NOT enforce
  a closed vocabulary — the slash command picks whatever's useful.
- **`/cp-capture`** slash command — harness-agnostic triage walker. Reads
  `cp inbox --json`, proposes a destination class per item (always confirmed
  with the user), performs the routing edit (quick task via the workflow
  provider, append to a phase PLAN.md, append to STATE.md, or discard), then
  marks the item triaged via `cp inbox --tick`.
- **`lib/inbox.js`** — pure file-IO module: `parseInbox`, `renderInbox`,
  `appendItem`, `markTriaged`, `listInbox`, `isoMinute`, `inboxPath`,
  `INBOX_FILENAME`. Returns the same `{actions, ...}` shape as
  `lib/lifecycle.js` so the CLI handlers route writes through
  `writeBatch` for free (atomic + transactional, per v0.3.2).
- **`templates/INBOX.md`** — bootstrap template with header + `## Open` /
  `## Triaged` sections and HTML-comment placeholders.

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-inbox.js`** — 45 new assertions covering parse/render
  round-trip, parser noise tolerance, `appendItem` happy path + dedup +
  empty-string error, `markTriaged` happy path + invalid-idx error +
  re-indexing, `listInbox` missing-file behaviour, null destination
  round-trip, plus an end-to-end CLI loop (`cp capture` → `cp inbox --json`
  → `cp inbox --tick --note` → `cp inbox --all`) including the v0.3.3
  commit-scoping invariant (dirty siblings stay out of the inbox commit).
- Test totals: **603 assertions** across 11 suites, all green.

### Notes

- `INBOX.md` lives at `.planning/INBOX.md`. It is committed (state-layer
  artifact) but considered ephemeral — `/cp-capture` rotates items out
  to phase PLANs / STATE.md / quick dirs as fast as practical.
- The slash command does NOT auto-create phases or milestones from inbox
  items — it surfaces them as `phase-seed:` / `milestone-seed:` tags and
  lets `/cp-new-milestone` or `/cp-plan-phase` pick them up later.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-20

Closes all three Mediums + the Low from the v0.3.3 dogfood `/cp-map-codebase`
re-run. No new public API; all three fixes harden existing surfaces.

### Fixed — `writeBatch` is now rollback-safe (CONCERNS Medium)

- `lib/lifecycle.js writeBatch()` previously had a destructive-last guarantee
  but no rollback for the rename phase itself. If `fs.renameSync` failed on
  the Nth file after the first N-1 had already landed, on-disk state was
  left half-replaced. Now:
  - Before renaming, snapshot each destination's pre-batch contents (regular
    files only; non-files snapshot as `unsnapshottable` and the rename will
    fail on them anyway).
  - If any rename throws, walk the completed renames in reverse and restore
    the snapshots via the temp+rename pattern (so readers never see a
    half-written rollback either).
  - For dests that did NOT exist before the batch, rollback unlinks them.
  - Any unrenamed temps are unlinked to avoid `.cp-tmp-*` orphans.
  - The thrown error wraps the original rename error and reports how many
    rollbacks succeeded / failed (`error.cause`, `error.rollbackErrors`).
- The delete phase is still not rolled back — by design. If a delete fails
  after all writes succeeded, the new content is already on disk and the
  leftover file is logged in the error.

### Fixed — Installer collision protection (CONCERNS Medium)

- `cp install <copilot|claude>` used to silently overwrite every command /
  skill file on every re-run, including any local user customizations. Now:
  - **New `install/common.js writeFileSafe(dest, content, { force })`** —
    returns `{ status: 'written' | 'identical' | 'user-modified' }`. Skips
    writes when on-disk content already matches the source bytes (cheap
    idempotent re-installs), and refuses to overwrite differing content
    unless `force: true`.
  - Both `install/copilot.js` and `install/claude.js` use the new helper for
    every per-command write, print `+` / `=` / `!` markers per file, and end
    with a summary plus a warning listing locally-modified files that were
    NOT overwritten.
  - `cp install <harness> --force` opts into clobbering local edits.
  - When the install kept user-modified files (and `--force` wasn't passed),
    `cp install` now exits with code 3 so CI / shell scripts can detect it.
- The Claude `CLAUDE.md` cp block is still always rewritten — that path only
  touches text between `<!-- context-planning -->` markers, never user
  content elsewhere in the file.

### Fixed — `--key=value` argv form now works (CONCERNS Low)

- The hand-rolled per-subcommand argv loops only supported `--key value`
  (two-token form). `--key=value` silently became a bare unknown flag.
- **New `normalizeArgv(argv)`** in `bin/cp.js` runs as a pre-processor in
  `main()` and splits any `--key=value` token into `['--key', 'value']`
  before subcommand parsers see it. Empty `--key=` becomes `['--key', '']`.
  Bare flags, positional args, and `=` inside positional args are left
  untouched.
- `bin/cp.js` is now safe to `require()` from tests too — top-level
  `main(process.argv)` is gated behind `if (require.main === module)`.

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-v034.js`** — 39 new assertions covering: writeBatch happy
  path, writeBatch rollback when rename phase fails (with on-disk state
  fully restored, zero `.cp-tmp-*` orphans), writeBatch rollback for a
  not-previously-existing destination, `writeFileSafe` collision detection,
  end-to-end `cp install copilot` and `cp install claude` re-run idempotency
  and `--force` behaviour, `normalizeArgv` exhaustive cases, and a real-CLI
  end-to-end test of `cp scaffold-phase 1 --name=MVP --plans=2`.
- Test totals: **558 assertions** across 10 suites, all green.

### Changed

- `cp install <harness>` exit codes:
  - `0` — clean install (everything written or unchanged).
  - `2` — usage error (missing harness arg, unknown harness).
  - `3` — install kept user-modified files (re-run with `--force` to overwrite).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-19

Hotfix release that closes both **High** findings the live `/cp-map-codebase`
dry-fire against cp itself surfaced (the same dogfood run that produced the
v0.3.2 Critical). Same-day follow-up — no API churn beyond the deliberate
`gitCommit` signature widening.

### Fixed — `gitCommit` no longer sweeps the working tree (CONCERNS High)

- `lib/lifecycle.js gitCommit(root, message)` used `git add -A`, which would
  pull every dirty file in the working tree into a `cp:`-prefixed commit.
  Hit live during v0.3.2 work: `cp scaffold-codebase` swept in unrelated
  `README` / `CHANGELOG` / `bin/cp.js` edits under a misleading
  "scaffold-codebase" commit, requiring a soft-reset and re-commit.
- **New signature:** `gitCommit(root, message, options = {})` where
  `options.paths` is an explicit array of paths to stage. When omitted, the
  default is now `git add -- .planning/` (state-layer only) — NOT `add -A`.
  Set `options.planningOnly: false` to opt back into the legacy wide stage.
- **New helper `lib/lifecycle.pathsFromActions(actions)`** — extracts the
  unique path list from any lifecycle op's `actions[]` so callers can scope
  their commit to exactly what they touched.
- All 6 auto-commit call sites in `bin/cp.js` (`cmdTick`, `cmdWriteSummary`,
  `cmdScaffoldMilestone`, `cmdScaffoldPhase`, `cmdScaffoldCodebase`,
  `cmdCompleteMilestone`) now pass `{ paths: lifecycle.pathsFromActions(r.actions) }`.
  `completeMilestone` does the same internally.

### Fixed — `cp doctor` no longer warns about its own canonical layout (CONCERNS High)

- `lib/gsd-compat.js report()` unconditionally warned about short-form
  `PLAN.md` / `SUMMARY.md` as "incompatible with GSD" — but cp emits both by
  design (`scaffoldPhase` writes `PLAN.md`, `writeSummary` writes
  `{NN-MM}-SUMMARY.md`). The warning fired on every project cp scaffolded,
  including its own dogfood tree. Pure noise.
- New behaviour: warn ONLY when a phase dir contains BOTH a short-form AND a
  long-form sibling — the one case where the parser would actually have to
  guess. The warning text now also explains short-form is cp-canonical and
  long-form is GSD round-trip.
- `.planning/codebase` removed from `GSD_SENTINELS` — cp also writes it now
  (via `cp scaffold-codebase` / `/cp-map-codebase`, since v0.3.2). It is a
  shared dir, not a GSD-only one.

### Added — coverage

- **`test/unit-gitcommit.js`** — 26 new assertions: `pathsFromActions` shape,
  default-scope only stages `.planning/`, explicit paths scope correctly,
  relative paths accepted, empty staging returns null, `planningOnly: false`
  legacy mode preserved, end-to-end CLI runs (`scaffold-milestone`,
  `scaffold-phase`, `scaffold-codebase`) do NOT commit a dirty sibling file.
- **`test/unit-libs.js`** — short-form-PLAN cp-canonical (no warning) +
  short+long coexist (warning) assertions added to the gsd-compat section.
- Test totals: **519 assertions** across 9 suites, all green.

### Changed

- `lib/gsd-compat.js GSD_SENTINELS` no longer lists `.planning/codebase` —
  cp also writes it (since v0.3.2). Comment updated with the precedent list.

### Dogfood

- Run `/cp-map-codebase --force` after upgrading to verify both rows clear
  in the freshly regenerated `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-19

This release ships **`/cp-map-codebase`** (cp-native, no Superpowers required)
and the **atomic-write hotfix** for the data-integrity Critical that the
live `/cp-map-codebase` dry-fire against cp itself surfaced.

### Added — `/cp-map-codebase`
- **`/cp-map-codebase`** slash command — cp-native equivalent of GSD's
  `gsd-map-codebase`. Dispatches 4 parallel sub-agents (tech / arch / quality /
  concerns) via the host harness's native sub-agent primitive (Copilot CLI's
  `task` tool, Claude Code's Task tool, etc.) to produce 7 docs in
  `.planning/codebase/` (STACK, INTEGRATIONS, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE,
  CONVENTIONS, TESTING, CONCERNS). Filenames and layout match GSD exactly so
  `cp gsd-import` stays clean. Supports `--force` (overwrite) and `--fast`
  (single-agent scan with optional `--focus`). **No workflow provider involved.**
- **`cp scaffold-codebase [--force] [--no-commit] [--dry-run]`** CLI wrapper —
  creates `.planning/codebase/` and seeds 7 stub files from
  `templates/codebase/*.md`. Idempotent: refuses to overwrite existing files
  unless `--force`. Auto-commits unless `--no-commit`.
- **`cp codebase-status [--json]`** CLI wrapper — inventories
  `.planning/codebase/`: per-file existence, line count, byte size, and a
  "looks-stub" heuristic (≤ 40 lines OR contains the placeholder marker).
  Exits 1 if the dir is missing.
- **`lib/codebase-mapper.js`** — pure file-I/O module exposing
  `scaffoldCodebase`, `codebaseStatus`, `DOCS`, and `FOCUS_AREAS`
  (the 4-way split the slash command consumes to build agent prompts).
  Calls no LLM — fully unit-testable.
- **`templates/codebase/{7 files}.md`** — minimal stubs with section headers
  and HTML-comment guidance the mapper agents replace.
- **`test/unit-codebase.js`** — 39 assertions covering scaffold happy path,
  refuse-overwrite, `--force`, `--dry-run`, missing-`.planning/` error,
  `codebaseStatus` shape, stub-vs-filled heuristic.

### Fixed — atomic multi-file writes
- **Atomic single-file writes (CONCERNS Critical, closed).** `lib/lifecycle.js`
  `writeFile()` now writes to a sibling `.cp-tmp-{pid}-{rand}` file then
  `fs.renameSync`s it into place. The rename is atomic on POSIX and on NTFS
  via `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)`. Readers will see either old or
  new content, never a half-written file. Temp files are cleaned up if the
  write step throws.
- **Multi-file transactional batch (`writeBatch`).** New helper exported from
  `lib/lifecycle.js`. Stages every `write` action to a temp file FIRST; only
  after every temp lands does it rename them into place; ONLY THEN does it
  apply `delete` actions. Used by `completeMilestone` so the destructive
  `delete .planning/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md` step can never run before the
  replacement `MILESTONES.md` / collapsed `ROADMAP.md` / reset `STATE.md`
  are durably on disk. Closes the Critical surfaced by the live
  `/cp-map-codebase` dry-fire against cp itself.
- **`test/unit-atomic.js`** — 23 assertions: no-temp-leftover on success,
  atomic overwrite, temp cleanup on failure, `writeBatch` apply order,
  deletes-only-after-writes invariant, abort-on-staged-write-failure rollback
  (deletes never run), `skip` / unknown-kind action handling, end-to-end
  `completeMilestone` run with zero `.cp-tmp-*` orphans under `.planning/`.

### Changed
- README "Slash commands" table gains `/cp-map-codebase` row; "Node CLI" block
  adds `cp scaffold-codebase` + `cp codebase-status` entries; Roadmap gains a
  "v0.3.x — `/cp-map-codebase`" milestone entry.
- `package.json` `scripts.test` now includes `unit-codebase` and `unit-atomic`.
  `npm test` runs 9 suites totalling ~491 assertions (up from 429).
- `lib/lifecycle.js` exports `writeFile` and `writeBatch` publicly so future
  cp libs (and external callers) can opt into the same atomicity guarantees
  instead of reimplementing temp+rename.

### Design notes
- **Why map-codebase is cp-native, not provider-delegated.** This work is
  upfront context gathering that writes structured state — it has no analog
  in Superpowers' workflow-skill catalogue (brainstorm / plan / execute /
  review / debug / TDD / verify), and using a workflow-provider role here
  would only add latency and lose the 4-way parallelism. cp owns it directly,
  in the same way it owns `cp init` and `cp scaffold-*`. The provider
  abstraction is for *workflow* work only.
- **Brownfield bootstrap order:** `cp scaffold-codebase` → `/cp-map-codebase`
  → `cp init`. Running `/cp-map-codebase` first gives `cp init` real context
  to ground PROJECT.md against, matching the GSD recommendation for existing
  codebases.
- **Eating our own dogfood.** The atomic-write Critical was found in <10 min
  by running `/cp-map-codebase` against cp's own source. The hotfix shipped
  in the same release. This is the value loop the whole project is built
  around.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`cp scaffold-milestone <name>`** wrapper — appends `### 🚧 <name> (In Progress)`
  (or `### 📋 <name> (Planned)` with `--planned`) inside ROADMAP's `## Phases`
  section. Refuses duplicates via case-insensitive substring match against
  `findMilestoneInRoadmap`. Auto-commits unless `--no-commit`.
- **`cp scaffold-phase <N> --name <name> [--plans <count>] [--milestone <name>]`**
  wrapper — inserts `### Phase N: <name>` under the active (or named)
  milestone in ROADMAP and creates `.planning/phases/{NN-slug}/PLAN.md` from
  the new `templates/phase-PLAN.md`. Pre-fills `- [ ] NN-MM: TBD` checkboxes
  for the requested plan count. Supports decimal phase numbers (e.g. `2.1`).
- **`templates/phase-PLAN.md`** — per-phase PLAN template with frontmatter
  (phase, name, milestone, status, created) and Goal/Success Criteria/Plans
  /Notes sections.
- 35 new assertions in `test/unit-lifecycle.js` (total: 66 → 101 in this file,
  ~429 across the full suite).
- README "v0.3 (shipped)" entry under Roadmap + new wrappers in CLI Surface.
- Migration leadership in `commands/cp/new-milestone.md` and `plan-phase.md`
  — both slash-commands now lead with the new wrappers and keep the original
  flow as the manual-provider fallback.

### Changed
- **`templates/ROADMAP.md` (breaking shape)** — removed `## Milestones` H2 bullet
  section and the placeholder `### Phase 1: {Name}` block. Fresh `cp init`
  now produces an empty `## Phases` section with usage hints; users run
  `cp scaffold-milestone` and `cp scaffold-phase` to populate. This fixes the
  template-vs-parser mismatch where `findMilestoneInRoadmap` returned `null`
  on a fresh `cp init` ROADMAP, AND eliminates the duplicate-`### Phase 1:`
  problem when `scaffold-phase 1` ran on a placeholder.
- `bin/cp.js`: `usage()` enumerates the new subcommands; `main()` switch
  dispatches them. Preserves the existing manual flag-parser pattern.

### Fixed
- `cmdCompleteMilestone` arg-parser block was accidentally dropped during a
  refactor in this version's working tree; caught by the v0.3 smoke test and
  restored before commit (no released version was affected).

### Verified
- End-to-end smoke at `%TEMP%\cp-v03-final`: `cp init` →
  `cp scaffold-milestone` → `cp scaffold-phase` → 2× (`cp write-summary` +
  `cp tick`) → `cp complete-milestone` produces a fully-shipped milestone
  with collapsed ROADMAP block, rich MILESTONES digest, reset STATE, and
  6 atomic commits **without ever editing a markdown file by hand**.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`lib/lifecycle.js`** (~400 LOC, 5 public functions) — the public,
  user-friendly API that hides the GSD lib-contract details that bit us
  during the v0.1 linkmark walkthrough.
- **`cp status [--json]`** — "you are here" report: current milestone,
  per-phase plan completion, next pending plan, next action.
- **`cp tick <plan-id> [--undo] [--no-commit] [--dry-run]`** — toggles a
  plan's checkbox in BOTH ROADMAP.md and the phase's `PLAN.md` (the
  `setPlanDone`-on-both gotcha). Idempotent. Auto-commits.
- **`cp write-summary <plan-id> --from <json> [--body <md>] [--overwrite] [--dry-run]`**
  — writes `{NN-MM}-SUMMARY.md` (no slug between!) with validated frontmatter.
  Normalises snake_case aliases (`subsystems` → `subsystem`, `files_created`
  → `key-files.created`, `requirements_completed` → `requirements-completed`,
  etc.) to the kebab-case names `aggregateSummaries` actually reads.
- **`cp complete-milestone [<name>] [--dry-run] [--no-commit] [--json]`** —
  full atomic close-out: verify all phases done → aggregate SUMMARYs → render
  digest → append to MILESTONES.md → collapse milestone in ROADMAP → clear
  MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md → reset STATE → commit.
- `test/unit-lifecycle.js` — 66 assertions across 6 sections.
- README rewrite (95 → 253 lines) — TL;DR flow diagram, comparison table,
  install steps, linkmark walkthrough, full CLI reference, provider
  abstraction with 11 roles, troubleshooting, roadmap.
- 3 slash-command rewrites (`complete-milestone.md`, `execute-phase.md`,
  `progress.md`) to lead with the new wrappers; original lib-level steps
  preserved as the manual-provider fallback.

### Notes
- Total tests: 328 → 394 across 7 files.
- End-to-end smoke at `%TEMP%\cp-cli-only-demo` proved CLI-only operation
  works without any direct lib call.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- Initial plugin: 8 slash commands (`new-project`, `new-milestone`,
  `plan-phase`, `execute-phase`, `quick`, `progress`, `resume`,
  `complete-milestone`).
- GSD-compatible state layer (`PROJECT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`,
  `MILESTONES.md`, phase + quick dirs) with shared `.planning/config.json`
  and a top-level `cp:` block for cp-specific keys.
- `cp init` scaffolds a fresh `.planning/`.
- `cp install copilot` / `cp install claude` installers (read-from-source,
  so re-running picks up the latest slash commands).
- `cp gsd-import` read-only audit of any planning project (cp or GSD).
- `cp doctor` shows resolved config, provider status, GSD compat report.
- `cp config get/set` for the `cp.*` block.
- Workflow-provider abstraction with `superpowers` and `manual` providers
  and 11 mappable roles (brainstorm, plan, execute, review, finish,
  worktree, tdd, debug, verify, …).
- 328 assertions across 6 test files (parser, gsd-import, complete-
  milestone, resume, round-trip, unit-lib).
