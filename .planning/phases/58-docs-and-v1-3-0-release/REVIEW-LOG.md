# Review Log: Phase 58 — Docs and v1.3.0 release

Append-only log of subagent review cycles during execution. Each entry is
written by the cp-execute-phase orchestrator after a review round
(spec-compliance or code-quality). The cp aggregator counts entries when
rolling up the milestone summary.

## How to append

The orchestrator (cp-execute-phase Step 4.5) appends a block per review:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — Plan NN-MM Task N — <reviewer-role>

**Verdict:** approved | rejected | needs-revision

**Findings:**

- <finding>

**Resolution:**

<what changed; commit SHA if applied>

```
