phase: "35"
name: DESIGN.md lifecycle polish
milestone: v0.9 Onboarding

# expected-key-files (optional, v0.8 P5) — declare what each plan
# intends to touch. `cp write-summary` will diff against the actual
# `key-files` and warn on drift (soft) or block (with --strict-expected).
# Two shapes accepted:
#   1. Flat array — phase-wide expected list:
#        expected-key-files:
#          - lib/foo.js
#          - test/foo.js
#   2. Object keyed by plan id — per-plan expectations:
#        expected-key-files:
#          {{NN}}-01:
#            - lib/foo.js
#          {{NN}}-02:
#            - bin/cli.js
